Make a folder (In the Example I called it esp8266) and put this vagrant folder in it. 
Make a another folder named projects in that same folder you just made.

Example:

c:/esp8266/
vagrant+
	   |
	   + Vagrantfile
	   
projects+
		|
		(Your projects folder name)
		...
		...
		...
		
Your projects folder will be mounted into the vagrant users home folder.
